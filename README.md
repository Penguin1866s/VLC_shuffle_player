# About

The <span style="color: #00FF00">VLC_shuffle_player</span>, is a python program that, with the xspf file you provide, generates a random playback order of the songs that are referenced by the xspf file, and then opens a VLC window, and plays the random playlist that has been temporarily generated[^1].

[^1]: **Summary**: It's a python program, that takes as input files that are playable by vlc, when executing it opens the vlc program to play a list with a random order of the files playable by vlc that it took as input.
